function result = myFunctionCorrected(input)
  % This function demonstrates the corrected way to handle potential issues with implicit expansion.
  a = [1; 2; 3];
  b = [4, 5, 6];

  % Check the dimensions of 'a' and 'b'
  if ~isequal(size(a), size(b))
      error('Dimensions of a and b must match for element-wise operations.');
  end
  
  result = a .* b; %This is corrected as dimensions are checked before operation

  % Another Example of handling implicit expansion error
  x = [1 2 3];
  y = 4;
  z = x + y;  %This would still work fine, however you might want to explicitly ensure it's working as you intend
  z = x + repmat(y, size(x,1),1); %This would expand y to match x's dimensions, making it explicit.
